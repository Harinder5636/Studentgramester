## Studentgramester


### 'Background'
I wanted to create a application which is very similar to instagram but only includes students. This would make it easier for students that go to the same school to come together and plan events.

## 'Next Step'
In the near future I plan on implementing many more features to the application including a path to add comments on each post, limiting posts per page, and deleting post cards.
